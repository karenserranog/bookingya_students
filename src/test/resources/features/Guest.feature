Feature: Guest Management
  As a hotel administrator
  I want to manage guest information
  So that I can keep guest records up to date

  Scenario: Create a new guest
    Given the system does not have a guest with identification "1007282715"
    When I create a guest with the following details:
      | identification | name                      | email                |
      | 1007282715     | Keiner Jose Reyes Serrano | testKeiner@gmail.com |
    Then the guest should be created successfully
    And the guest identification should be "1007282715"
